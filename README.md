This repository focuses on The Weather Channels rundown used from November 2013 to August 2019. Before using, adding, modyfying or testing, please read the following information.

You can set any amount of craws from 1 to 90. Adding more than 90 crawls is NOT allowed. 

You can add anything you want in the ``const crawls`` line, starting with a ``\`\`` and ending with a ``\`,`` at the end of the craw. Here is an example:
```
`This is a Test`,
```

Avoid using backticks (`) in crawl fields, like this:
```
`This i`s a test`,
```
This will cause a syntax error cause the script to fail. (This can be fixed by adding a backslash (`\`) before the backtick)
Example:
```
`This i\`s a test`,
```

If you want to add a block, add a ``#`` and type anything uppercase like:

```
`#THIS IS A TEST`,
```

Open the desired ``.html`` file on a fast graphics card computer for the best experience.
