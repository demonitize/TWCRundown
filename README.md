This repository focuses on The Weather Channels rundown used from November 2013 to August 2019. Before using, adding, modyfying or testing, please read the following information.

You can set any amout of craws from 1 to 90. **VERY** higher numbers are NOT allowed. 

You can add anything you want in the ``const crawls`` line, starting with a ``'`` and ending with a ``',`` at the end of the craw. Here is example:
```
'This is a Test',
```

No ' at any craw feld, like this:
```
'This i's a test',
```
This wil cause a syntax error causing the script to fail.

If you want to add a block, add a ``#`` and type anything uppercase like:

```
'#THIS IS A TEST',
```

Open the ``.html`` file in a fast graphics card computer for the best experience.
